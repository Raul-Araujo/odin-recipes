# odin-recipes

In this project I tried to use basic knowledges of HTML, such as:
    #Lists (unordered and ordered);
    #Links (in this specific case, only relative links);
    #Image (adding them);
    #HTML's structure;
    #Organizing an HTML project and its documents;
    #A little bit of CSS.
